What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git floder is created, this will help to kep track of how the files are changing.


To add files to git use git add

Files appear to need to be added individually

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains the files that will be used. The repository contains a history of changes that can be used to reconstuct the files for the current checkout commit. The staging area lists which files should be tracked by the repository.

To use git commit needed to reconfigure how to use gedit:

git config --global core.editor "gedit -s"

I am now trying out to see if it records changes such as as the one I am now writing.

I am  changing this file but nothing is happening.

Now try this.
