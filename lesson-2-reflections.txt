Using reflections directory to learn git basics

What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git floder is created, this will help to kep track of how the files are changing.


To add files to git use git add

Files appear to need to be added individually

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Workin directory contains the files that will be used. The repository contains a history of changes that can be used to reconstucr the files for the current checkedout commit. the staging are list which files should be tracked by the repository.

To use git commit needed reconfigure for gedit
git config --global core.editor "gedit -s"

I am now trying out to see if it records chages such as as the one I am now writing.

Am am changing this file but nothing is happening
