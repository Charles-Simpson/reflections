This lesson is about using github.

The first thing to do is to create a folder on the github site

This is known as a remote

Run the command

git remote add origin git@github.com/Charles-Simpson/reflections

git remote then returns origin as the remote folder?

the above instructions used ssh which caused problems, newer instruction is
to used https:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Charles-Simpson/reflections.git

then run

git push -u origin master

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working with other people on a group project or are working on a project from different locations.
